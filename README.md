# Number_Classifier
This model is to identifying the hand written number.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

Template code is provided in the `minst.png`.  While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project.This code contains two method for identifying the number.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Number_Classifier` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Part_1__Neural_networks_with_TensorFlow_and_keras_.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Part_1__Neural_networks_with_TensorFlow_and_keras_.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
